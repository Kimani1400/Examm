        <p>
            Wildlife refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans.<br>
            A wild animal is an animal that is, well, wild.<br> 
            This means that it isn't tame and it lives on its own without any help from people.<br>
            A wild animal finds its own food, shelter, water and all its other needs in a specific natural habitat.<br>
